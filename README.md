# Supply-Volume_Dashboard


## About project

Excited to share the successful completion of a strategic project aimed at revolutionizing our procurement decisions! ðŸš€ Leveraging Microsoft Power BI, we've developed a dynamic Supply Chain Dashboard that consolidates diverse data from multiple years, plants, and business units.
Our Accounts Department's invoice details now provide valuable insights for the Business Planner, who navigates through supplier and part-level information from the Purchase Department. ðŸ“Š The dashboard meticulously studies procurement trends, supplier limitations, and product-based consolidation, offering a comprehensive view to minimize cost impact and guide our procurement strategy.
This project was a collaborative effort, considering factors such as material types (Aluminium or Ferrous), raw material grades, and supplier tiers (Tier 1 or Tier 2). The result is a powerful tool that empowers our Procurement Department to make data-driven decisions for a more efficient and cost-effective supply chain.
